# ERC777-Test-Redistributor-Token
This is a working model for the Test Redistributor Token which runs on Mumbai Polygon testnet (0x7087675C3A2e54D48664D5Ff34FEdd23384FB733).
The contracts are written by an enthusiast with the help of ChatGPT. If you wanna create your own redistributor tokens you can use
these contracts for testing, but you will need to develop them and modify further, for commercial use.
